# Context

In blockchain applications , integrating Ethereum interfaces is key to interacting with smart contracts, handling
transactions, and managing blockchain data. This architecture view evaluates various libraries and approaches for
interfacing with Ethereum within a Next.js environment.

# Constraints

- The interface should be lightweight to ensure fast client-side performance and minimal bundle size.
- Sensitive operations (e.g., managing private keys or API secrets) must be handled securely, potentially via
  server-side mechanisms.
- The solution should efficiently support a growing user base and be compatible with different Ethereum networks or
  providers.
- Prefer libraries with strong TypeScript support, clear APIs, and good documentation to facilitate maintenance and
  future updates.
- The chosen option should integrate seamlessly with Next.js, considering both client-side and server-side requirements.

# Studied Options

## Web3.js

Pro's

- Mature and widely adopted, with a large community and extensive documentation.
- Offers comprehensive functionality for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts.
- Broad compatibility with various Ethereum networks and providers.

Con's

- Larger bundle size can negatively impact client performance in a Next.js app.
- Limited support for modern development practices and TypeScript, which may affect code maintainability.
- More monolithic design can lead to increased integration complexity in modern React/Next.js projects.

** Rejected due to the larger bundle size and limited TypeScript support. **

## Ethers.js

Pro's

- Lightweight and modular design helps keep bundle sizes small.
- Excellent TypeScript support, resulting in a more robust and maintainable codebase.
- Clean, modern API that simplifies interactions with Ethereum smart contracts and error handling.

Con's

- Slightly smaller community compared to Web3.js, although its popularity is rapidly growing.
- Some advanced functionalities may be less comprehensive than those available in Web3.js.

** Rejected due to potential limitations in advanced features. **

## Viem and Wagmi - Validated

Pro's

- Wagmi offers a suite of React hooks specifically designed for Ethereum interactions, while Viem provides a
  streamlined, modern API, both of which integrate naturally with Next.js.
- Both libraries are built with TypeScript in mind, offering strong type safety and a smooth developer experience.
- Designed to keep bundle sizes minimal, which is ideal for performance-sensitive Next.js applications.
- Wagmi abstracts common tasks such as wallet connections and contract interactions into easy-to-use hooks, reducing
  boilerplate and accelerating development.
- As newer libraries, they benefit from modern design patterns and active community-driven improvements.

Con's

- Being relatively new, their community, ecosystem, and third-party integrations may not be as extensive as those for
  Web3.js or Ethers.js.
- While improving rapidly, the documentation and available examples may be less comprehensive compared to older
  libraries.
- Developers accustomed to traditional libraries might need time to adapt to the modern paradigms and API structures.
- As these projects mature, breaking changes or evolving APIs might occur more frequently compared to established
  alternatives.

** Validated due to their lightweight design, strong TypeScript support, and seamless integration with Next.js. **
